                    <h3>
                        Over my 8-month work term at Kenna I was part of a small team that developed a Web Application called AgDeliver. The purpose of this application was to collect data from hundreds of Retailers that sold BASF agricultu

                    <h3>
                        I worked in a small 3-member agile team. We used Jira boards and GIT to keep track of tickets for feature implementaions and bug fixes. This also helped to break down large modules to small managable pieces that I could focus on individually to build complicated modules.
                        The project consisted of using SQL stored procedures on MSQL and querying data from SQL tables from NodeJS to process data on interactable tables in the frontend, built using ReactJS and the KendoReact library

                            <li>Developed and optimized SQL queries and stored procedures to fetch data to render it onto the front-end</li>

                    <h1>Goals & Skills</h1>
                    <h3>
                        Working at Kenna was an amazing opportunity for me to grow and learn new skills that will benefit me in future work experiences.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        My technical skills have improved over the past 8 months. When I first started working, I was not at all confident working in large projects with multiple technologies. The huge code base, data, and the many technologies used to develop my project was a bit daunting at first. Though with experience, learning from my mistakes, and guidance from my mentor, I quickly became much more comfortable developing new features and navigating the codebase. Specifically I learned a lot on implement solutions using ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, and SQL.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        I also gained experience working in an agile team. I got the opportunities to work on a project module from the beginning stages where we prioritized module requirements and set up timelines for deliverables, through developing code and deploying it to test.  Our team used Jira scrum boards to track and prioritize implementation and bug tickets. Through this process I got better with time management and prioritizing tasks. 

                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        In my day-to-day task, I spend a lot of time going through the React, Node, Sql stack trying to find and resolve bug. I had to quickly gain an intimate knowledge of the code base as well as debugging and testing techniques the would allow me to quickly find solutions to production bugs.
